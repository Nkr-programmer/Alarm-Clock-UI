This project is about the UI and Animations.
By using these I have  made a clock  and some 
other cool stuffs. For these I have used custom paint  
. I have  used Neumorphic Design to make it more Beautiful
sttuffs. I have used a Library called Snappable.
This used to convert any widget into dust . That creates a nice eect
and on clicking it again it widget appeared. By this project
I learned more about Beautiful UI , Animation and Custom Paints.
